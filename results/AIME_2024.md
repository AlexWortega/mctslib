We can apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of residents who own at least one of the four items. The inclusion-exclusion principle states that the total number of residents who own at least one of the four items is equal to the sum of the number of residents who own each item separately, minus the number of residents who own exactly two items, minus the number of residents who own exactly three items, plus the number of residents who own exactly four items. |

Since 9 is the unique mode of the list, we can write the sum of the list as 9a + 9b, where a and b are positive integers that do not include 9. To see this, note that 9 appears more than once in the list, and thus must be a common factor in the sum of the list. Since 9 is the only positive integer that appears more than once in the list, we can conclude that 9 is the unique mode of the list. Therefore, we can write the sum of the list as 9a + 9b, where a and b are positive integers that do not include 9.                                                                                                                                  |

The top row must consist of two 9's and one 0, with the remaining digits spread among the three cells. This is the only possible arrangement because the total sum of the digits in the top row must be 18, and the only way to achieve this is with two 9's and one 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Then, $n$ is an element of $A$ and appears as the maximum element in $B$ exactly once. Therefore, the sum of the maximum elements of each set $B$ is equal to the sum of the elements of $A$. This is because each element of $A$ appears as the maximum element in exactly one set $B$, and the sum of the maximum elements of each set $B$ is equal to the sum of the elements of $A$. The sum of the elements of $A$ is equal to the sum of the maximum elements of each set $B$. Therefore, the sum of the elements of $A$ is 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The largest four-digit integer that satisfies this condition is $N=9999$. Changing the first digit to $1$ gives $1999$, which is divisible by $7$. Changing the second digit to $1$ gives $11999$, which is also divisible by $7$. Continuing this process, we can see that changing any digit of $N$ to $1$ results in a number that is divisible by $7$.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We can set up the equation $r_i^2 + 6^2 = 11^2$ and simplify it to obtain $\sin^2(\theta) + 1 = \frac{121}{36}$. Since $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$, we can substitute the expression for $\sin^2(\theta)$ into the equation and solve for $\cos^2(\theta)$. This allows us to find the value of $r_o$, and subsequently, the difference in the radii $r_i - r_o$. The final answer is $m+n=\boxed{11}$.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Since $a+b+c=300$, we can simplify the expression to $3(a+b+c)^2$. Equating this expression to $6,000,000$, we obtain $3(300)^2=6,000,000$.

Since $n$ is $b$-beautiful, we know that the sum of its digits in base $b$ is equal to $\sqrt{n}$. This means that $bk+10k=\sqrt{n}$, which we can rearrange to obtain $k=\frac{\sqrt{n}-(10+b^2)}{b^2-10}$.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

However, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose two sides that form a diagonal, which is 6C2. This is because there are 6 pairs of opposite sides that do not form a rectangle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
